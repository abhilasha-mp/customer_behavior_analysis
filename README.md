📊 Data Analysis Project README


🧩 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow from raw data ingestion to business insights presentation. It includes Python-based data exploration, SQL querying, Power BI dashboarding, and report generation. The final deliverables are a comprehensive report and a presentation built using Gamma.
📁 Dataset
- Source: [Specify source, e.g., Kaggle, internal database, etc.]
- Format: CSV
- Contents: Includes fields such as customer demographics, transactions, product details, and timestamps.
- 
🚀 Project Steps

* Load Dataset
- Import CSV using Pandas
- Inspect structure and data types
 
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Missing value analysis
- Visualizations (histograms, box plots, correlations)
  
* Data Cleaning
- Handle nulls and duplicates
- Normalize formats (dates, categories)
- Feature engineering

* SQL Integration
- Load cleaned data into MySQL
- Run queries for segmentation, aggregation, and filtering
  
* Dashboard Creation
- Connect Power BI to MySQL
- Build visuals: KPIs, trends, filters, drill-downs

* Report Writing
- Summarize findings, insights, and recommendations
- Include visuals and SQL outputs

* Presentation
- Create a Gamma deck to showcase key insights
- Tailor for business stakeholders and recruiters

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python: Used for loading the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and cleaning the data. Key libraries include Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Utilized for visualizing data distributions, trends, and relationships during the EDA phase.
- MySQL: The cleaned dataset is loaded into a MySQL server where SQL queries are executed for deeper data segmentation, aggregation, and filtering.
- Power BI: Connected to the MySQL database to build interactive dashboards that highlight key metrics, trends, and insights.
- Gamma: Used to create a polished presentation deck that summarizes the project findings in a visually engaging format.
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Served as the development environment for writing and executing Python scripts and SQL queries.
- SQLAlchemy / pymysql: Enabled seamless integration between Python and MySQL for data transfer and querying.
